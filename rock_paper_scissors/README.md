# ✊ Rock Paper Scissors Game 🎮

A simple command-line implementation of the classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game using Python. This project is part of my Python learning journey and helps reinforce concepts like conditionals, loops, user input, and randomization.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The player chooses between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The computer randomly selects its move.
- The winner is determined based on standard game rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Scissors beats Paper
  - Paper beats Rock

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive command-line interface
- Randomized computer moves using `random` module
- Input validation and replay option
- Score tracking (optional enhancement)

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries are needed.
