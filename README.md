# 🐍 Python Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly Python projects! This repository is a playground where I explore core programming concepts through fun, bite-sized applications. Each project is self-contained and designed to reinforce skills like conditionals, loops, functions, and working with libraries.
